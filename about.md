# About Me

I am currently pursuing a master’s in data science at the University of California, Irvine. In 2021, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering. For the past 4 years, I have worked in an early stage, cardiac technology startup utilizing data analytics, predictive models, and signal processing to identify gaps in clinical research.
