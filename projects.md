# Arrhythmia Detection (WIP)
Detecting ECG arrhythmias using MIT BIH data source. Used data processing and classification algorithms to identify R peaks, S peaks, as well as identify when R peaks are too close together.

# Blood Pressure Analysis in cardiac rehab patients
Utilized pandas and bokeh for data analysis, examining blood pressure measurement variances in cardiac rehab patients. Characterized DUT data accuracy, revealing that 93% of the data had shifts below 15mmHg. 

# Biosignal Library (WIP)
Working towards creating a comprehensive biosignal manipulation library.
